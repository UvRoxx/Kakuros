# Kakuros
This is a simple version of the Kakuro Game made entirely in Swift, powered by a self-designed API and Firebase, along with other libraries.

We have to download the repo and complie it either with catylist on Mac(reference: https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/ ) or run the app as a Mac app to have the direct nataive support for the desktop UI.
